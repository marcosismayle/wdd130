    <p>Hey, what's up. Let me introduce myself for you guys.
        I'm married since 2014 with my beloved first girlfriend,
        Karol. We have two children. Maria Valentina, 5 years old
        and, Melissa, 2 years old. I live in Campinas, a city in SÃ£o Paulo
        in Brazil. I love living here because we have a temple near by.</p>
    <p>I'm a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
        since 2010. I was a missionary in Bahia between 2011 and 2013.</p>
    <p>I'm a Bulding Technician and a Civil Engineering stutent. But, since
        the primary school, when I used a computer for the first time,
        I love IT. For many years I though a career in IT was impractible for me.
        But now I'm determined to change the course of my life.</p>
    <p>And that was a little bit about me, I'm excited to read about you guys.</p>
    <p>Bye!</p>
