        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
            Oba! Now it`s time to introduce who we are to you. And to the beginning, we want to introduce who is behind<br>
            the Oba É Festa. That is Maria da Conceição, a warrior woman. She has three children which she has to create<br>
            by herself as a single mother. And she works a lot to get this objective. Her greater professional<br>
            experience is as a cooker for many years in restaurants in the city. Also, she worked as a housekeeper in<br>
            her youth. And the opportunities were low, she gives a way seeling snacks on a bike. So, she understands<br>
            serving, worrying, and taking care of others. As a cooker, she learned about giving amazing experiences to<br>
            people. Unfortunately, because of health problems, she has to abandon her profession as a cooker, but the<br>
            desire to serve and to enchant never died. And then borns the Oba.<br>
            Every day is a special day. And everybody has reasons to celebrate. A new child was born, a birthday for<br>
            someone special, or who knows a wedding. Even if you want to do a big or a little party, celebrating is<br>
            essential. By celebrating we can show our gratitude and we can share our happiness with those who care about
            us.<br>
            Celebrating, making parties, and hanging out with others have the power to make us more mentally healthy.<br>
            Celebrating has the power to liberate endorphin, serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin, which are hormones that<br>
            make us feel good and happier. So, don't celebrate it is a loss of opportunity to spoon all these benefits.<br>
            Celebrating also has the power to make us more confident, alert, and cheerful.<br>
            We don't want people sad. We want to be part of your reasons for being happy. The Oba is here to help you<br>
            have these benefits. So, let us go celebrate.<br>
            In the next section, we want to invite you to about our mission, vision, and values.<br>

            Our mission:<br>
            Our mission is giving to people the sparkle in their eyes through high-quality and,<br>
            personalized event services.<br>
