                <p>Oba! Now it`s time to introduce who we are to you. And to the beginning, we want to introduce who is behind
                    the Oba É Festa. That is Maria da Conceição, a warrior woman. She has three children which she has to create
                    by herself as a single mother. And she works a lot to get this objective. Her greater professional
                    experience is as a cooker for many years in restaurants in the city. Also, she worked as a housekeeper in
                    her youth. And the opportunities were low, she gives a way seeling snacks on a bike. So, she understands
                    serving, worrying, and taking care of others. As a cooker, she learned about giving amazing experiences to
                    people. Unfortunately, because of health problems, she has to abandon her profession as a cooker, but the
                    desire to serve and to enchant never died. And then borns the Oba.
                    Every day is a special day. And everybody has reasons to celebrate. A new child was born, a birthday for
                    someone special, or who knows a wedding. Even if you want to do a big or a little party, celebrating is
                    essential. By celebrating we can show our gratitude and we can share our happiness with those who care about us.
                    Celebrating, making parties, and hanging out with others have the power to make us more mentally healthy.
                    Celebrating has the power to liberate endorphin, serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin, which are hormones that
                    make us feel good and happier. So, don't celebrate it is a loss of opportunity to spoon all these benefits.
                    Celebrating also has the power to make us more confident, alert, and cheerful.
                    We don't want people sad. We want to be part of your reasons for being happy. The Oba is here to help you
                    have these benefits. So, let us go celebrate.
                    In the next section, we want to invite you to meet about our mission, vision, and values.</p>
